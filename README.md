# Heart Disease Prediction Using a Neural Network

This project applies a feed-forward neural network to predict the presence of heart disease in patients using the Heart Disease Dataset. This is a binary classification task where the target variable indicates the presence (`1`) or absence (`0`) of heart disease.

# Dataset
The dataset contains various health metrics for patients, such as age, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure. The target variable is "output," which is binary (1 for disease, 0 for no disease).
Dataset can be found on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset 

# Model Architecture
The neural network is a feed-forward model with:
- **Input Layer**: 13 features
- **Hidden Layer 1**: 16 neurons with ReLU activation
- **Hidden Layer 2**: 8 neurons with ReLU activation
- **Output Layer**: 1 neuron with Sigmoid activation for binary classification
