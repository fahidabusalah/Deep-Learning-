# Heart Disease Prediction Using a Neural Network

This project applies a feed-forward neural network to predict the presence of heart disease in patients using the Heart Disease Dataset. This is a binary classification task where the target variable indicates the presence (`1`) or absence (`0`) of heart disease.

# Dataset
The dataset contains various health metrics for patients, such as age, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure. The target variable is "output," which is binary (1 for disease, 0 for no disease).
